# MPU

The MPU is an optional component in Cortex-M processor systems. In systems that require high reliability, the MPU can protect memory regions by defining access permissions for different privilege states. The MPU can also define other memory attributes such as Cacheability, which can be exported to system-level cache unit or memory controllers.

# MMU

The Memory Management Unit (MMU) is responsible for the translation of virtual addresses used by software to physical addresses used in the memory system.

The MMU contains the following:

* The table walk unit, which contains logic that reads the translation tables from memory.
* Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs), which cache recently used translations.
