# Memory Width

* Number of bits memory returns on **each access**. Ex: 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit

|Instruction Size|8-bit memory|16-bit memory|32-bit memory|
|----------------|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|ARM 32-bit|4 cycles|2 cycles|1 cycle|
|Thumb 16-bit|2 cycles|1 cycle|1 cycle|

# Memory Types

* **ROM (Read Only Memory)**: Cannot be reprogrammed
* **Flash ROM**: Can be written and read
* **DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)**: Lowest cost per megabyte compared to other RAMs
* **SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)**: Faster than DRAM (does not require pauses between data accesses)
* **SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory)**: Runs at much higher clock rate
* **EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)**: Can be written and read. Store critical data that remains intact even when power is off

# Bit Size

32-bit ARM Processors:

* Internal registers in the register bank are 32-bit
* Data paths are 32-bit
* Bus interfaces are 32-bit

Bit size allows the CPU to address memory for an individual process.

* `x` bit can handle `2^x` **bytes** of memory

The higher the bit size the higher the performance.

So, 32-bit can handle,
`2^32` = `4294967296` bytes â‰ˆ 4.2 GB
