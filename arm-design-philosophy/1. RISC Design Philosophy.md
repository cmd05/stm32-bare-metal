- **RISC** - Reduced instruction Set Computer
- **CISC** - Complex Instruction Set Computer

# RISC Architecture

- Instructions - Reduced number of instructions
- Pipelines - Instructions are executed in parallel by pipelines
- Registers - Large general-purpose register set
- Load-Store - Processor operates on data held in registers

RISC processors are capable of **one instruction per cycle** (**single cycle processor**)
