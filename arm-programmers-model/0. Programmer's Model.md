It describes the architecture of the microprocessor (here ARM microprocessor) from the perspective of a programmer.

* Things the programmer must know to write working software for the hardware
* In a computer system, the programmers model shows what the CPU has available to a programmer for the execution of computer programs. It covers the CPU resources for execution of the CPU's instruction set.

# ARM Programmer's Model

The processor implements the ARM v7-M architecture. This includes the entire 16-bit Thumb instruction set and the base Thumb-2 32-bit instruction set architecture. The processor cannot execute ARM instructions.

The Thumb instruction set is a subset of the ARM instruction set, re-encoded to 16 bits. It supports higher code density and systems with memory data buses that are 16 bits wide or narrower.

Thumb-2 is a major enhancement to the Thumb *Instruction Set Architecture* (ISA). Thumb-2 enables higher code density than Thumb and offers higher performance with 16/32-bit instructions.
