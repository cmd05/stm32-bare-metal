# Registers

* A register is a **storage** inside the processor core
* ARM processors have a number of registers inside the processor core to perform data processing and control
* Most of these registers are grouped in a unit called the **register bank**

# ARM7TDMI Processor

* 30 General-Purpose Registers
* 6 Status Registers
* 1 Program Counter Register

## Register bank for different processor modes

Note: `user` mode is unprivileged while `system` mode is privileged

## Register Types

* The **general purpose registers** (R0-R12) contain data or addresses
* R13 is known as the **Stack Pointer (SP)** and it points to the top element of the stack
* R14 is known as the **Link Register (LR)** and its used to store the return location for functions
* R15 is known as the **Program Counter (PC)**. It is readable and writeable.
  * Reading PC returns current instruction address plus 4
  * Writing to PC causes a branch operation

## CPSR and SPSR

A **Saved Program Status Register (SPSR)** is a banked register used in computer processors to hold a copy of the **Current Program Status Register (CPSR)** during exceptions. It ensures that the status of the processor is preserved when handling exceptions without disturbing the original status register.
