# Exception Vector Table

When an exception occurs, the processor branches to an offset in the *exception vector table*, depending on the cause of the exception. Table 6.14 describes the vector table, which is normally located starting at address 0x00000000 in memory. For example, when an interrupt occurs, the processor branches to address 0x00000018. Similarly, on power-up, the processor branches to address 0x00000000. Each exception vector offset typically contains a branch instruction to an [exception handler](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/exception-handler "Learn more about exception handler from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), code that handles the exception and then either exits or returns to the user code.
